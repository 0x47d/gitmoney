Below is some useful information to get you writing. This should give you a general overview of what Git Money is and how it works.

**What is Git Money?**

Git Money connects open source repositories with under represented talent around the world. With Git Money, project owners are able to post bounties for work they need completed. Anyone can submit their corresponding work (via github pull request) and get paid instantly for their contribution. 

**Why does this project matter?** 

Git Money connects companies/projects with talent that they would otherwise not have access to, vice versa. Contributers are able to make money from anywhere in the world for the quality of their work! 

**Who works on Git Money?**

Git Money is made up of a team of collaborators from the [21 slack channel](https://slack.21.co).

**When and how was Git Money created?**

This project came together at the first [21 hackers](http://21hackers.com) hackathon in January. The idea came about from a group of entrepreneurs and developers talking about how to get developers to work on projects that were being worked on outside of tech hubs. The project was architected and prototyped through a Google Hangouts video chat and continued to come together in the following weekends. You may find a list of contributors here:
